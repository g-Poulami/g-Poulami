## 🧑‍💻 About Me  
I am currently pursuing **MSc Bioinformatics** at the **College of Medicine and Health, University of Birmingham**. My master’s thesis focuses on **MRI analysis of paediatric brain tumours** using advanced machine learning techniques, in collaboration with Birmingham Children’s Hospital.  

I have experience in building **CT image segmentation pipelines** using UNet with ResNet18 encoders pretrained with MoCo or SimCLR. I am also skilled in **Generative AI for medical imaging**, including image enhancement, data augmentation, and synthetic dataset generation.  

**Technical Skills:** Python, PyTorch, R, Bash/Linux, MATLAB, Machine Learning & Deep Learning frameworks.
